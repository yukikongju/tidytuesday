# Heart Attack

An analysis of heart attack predictors 


## Leading Questions

1. Who are the most susceptible to have a heart attack? 
   - What are the most significative predictors of heart attack? We will perform 
     a multiple linear regression and perform hypothesis testing on each of 
     the model coefficient.
2. What is the best model we can develop to predict who has had a heart attack? 
   - We will compare a few models and select the best one. The models tested: 
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree and Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine
     - Bayes Classifier
     - MLP
