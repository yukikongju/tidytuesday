## Load Data

```{r echo=false}

folder1 <- "C:/Users/emuli/OneDrive/Documents/R/Projects/tidytuesday/us_birth/data/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv"
folder2 <- "C:/Users/emuli/OneDrive/Documents/R/Projects/tidytuesday/us_birth/data/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv"

us_births_1994_2003_raw <- read.csv(file = folder1, header = TRUE, sep=",")
us_births_2000_2014_raw <- read.csv(file= folder2, header = TRUE, sep = ",")

us_births_2000_2014_raw$births <- as.numeric(us_births_2000_2014_raw$births)
us_births_1994_2003_raw$births <- as.numeric(us_births_1994_2003_raw$births)

overlap <- us_births_1994_2003_raw %>% 
  rename(births2 = births) %>% 
  merge(us_births_2000_2014_raw) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(births3=round(mean(c(births, births2)), 0)) %>% 
  select(-c(births, births2)) %>% 
  rename(births=births3)


```

## Data Preprocessing

```{r echo=FALSE}

## make ts
library(xts)

births_ts <- overlap %>% 
  unite("date", year, month, date_of_month, sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(date=as.Date(date)) %>% 
  select(-c(day_of_week)) 

births_ts <- xts(births_ts[,-1], order.by = as.Date(births_ts[,'date'], format="%m%d%y") )

## group birth day by year


```

## Data Exploration

```{r}

## make heatmap by day of the week




## make time series

library(forecast)
autoplot(births_ts)

```
